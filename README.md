# Problem Statement

Key financial institutions have reported an increase in False Positives from their Machine Learning and AI systems due to severe market changes, rendering their models obsolete. While analysts have recalibrated the models, the approval and deployment process is time-consuming, posing a significant challenge.

# Objective

To create a user-friendly and efficient application that automates the generation of structured approval documents for recalibrated ML models, ensuring compliance with industry standards and significantly reducing the time required for approval by financial institutions.

# Benefit

The application will minimize the time-consuming approval process for recalibrated ML models, thereby enhancing the responsiveness of financial institutions to market changes. This will reduce the risk of financial instability caused by outdated models, ensuring quicker adaptation and sustained operational efficiency.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
